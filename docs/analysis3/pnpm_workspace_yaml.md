- No guidance about where new packages should be placed
- Unclear package organization principles

**Impact**: 
- Developers may not understand proper package placement
- Inconsistent package organization over time
- Missing onboarding guidance for new team members
- Potential for package structure confusion

### **NO SPECIALIZED WORKSPACE CONFIGURATION**
**Issue**: Basic workspace configuration without trading-specific optimizations or conventions.

**Evidence**: 
- No trading-specific package categories
- Missing configuration for specialized package types
- No workspace-level trading platform conventions
- Basic configuration without domain-specific enhancements

**Impact**: 
- Missed opportunities for trading-specific workspace organization
- Potential for inconsistent package categorization
- Missing domain-specific package management patterns

### **LIMITED EXTENSIBILITY DOCUMENTATION**
**Issue**: No guidance about extending the workspace for new package types or organizational patterns.

**Evidence**: 
- No documentation about adding new package categories
- Missing guidelines for workspace expansion
- No examples of package organization best practices
- Limited guidance for complex package hierarchies

**Impact**: 
- Difficulty scaling workspace organization
- Inconsistent approaches to workspace expansion
- Missing best practices for complex package structures

## Recommendations

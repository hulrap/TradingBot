- **Impact**: Good type safety for frontend development
- **Misalignment**: Positive alignment with monorepo TypeScript usage

### 14. **Build and Development Scripts**
- **Issue**: Standard Next.js scripts without trading-specific optimizations
- **Impact**: Basic development workflow without specialized scripts
- **Misalignment**: Should include trading-specific development scripts

### 15. **Bundle Size Optimization**
- **Issue**: Heavy dependencies may impact bundle size
- **Impact**: Potentially large frontend bundle affecting performance
- **Misalignment**: Should optimize bundle size for trading application

### 16. **Environment Configuration**
- **Issue**: No explicit environment configuration dependencies
- **Impact**: Environment management may not be optimized
- **Misalignment**: Should include environment management tools

### 17. **Testing Framework Absence**
- **Issue**: No testing framework or testing dependencies
- **Impact**: Frontend without proper testing infrastructure
- **Misalignment**: Should include comprehensive testing setup

### 18. **Performance Monitoring Gaps**
- **Issue**: No performance monitoring or analytics dependencies
- **Impact**: Limited visibility into frontend performance
- **Misalignment**: Should include performance monitoring for trading UI

### 19. **Security Dependencies**
- **Issue**: Limited security-specific dependencies for trading application
- **Impact**: Security considerations may not be addressed
- **Misalignment**: Should include security hardening for financial UI

### 20. **PWA and Offline Support**
- **Issue**: No Progressive Web App or offline capabilities
- **Impact**: Limited mobile and offline trading capabilities
- **Misalignment**: Should consider PWA for trading application

### 21. **Internationalization Absence**
- **Issue**: No internationalization dependencies
- **Impact**: Limited global accessibility for trading platform
- **Misalignment**: Should consider i18n for global trading platform

### 22. **Error Tracking and Monitoring**
- **Issue**: No error tracking or monitoring dependencies
- **Impact**: Limited error visibility in production
- **Misalignment**: Should include error tracking for trading application

### 23. **SEO and Meta Management**
- **Issue**: No specific SEO or meta tag management
- **Impact**: Basic SEO for trading platform
- **Misalignment**: Should optimize SEO for trading platform visibility

### 24. **Component Documentation**
- **Issue**: No component documentation or storybook dependencies
- **Impact**: Limited component documentation and design system
- **Misalignment**: Should include component documentation tools

### 25. **Deployment and CI/CD Integration**
- **Issue**: No deployment-specific dependencies or configurations
- **Impact**: Basic deployment without optimization
- **Misalignment**: Should include deployment optimization tools

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Blockchain Integration**: Move heavy blockchain operations to backend
2. **Remove Database Dependencies**: Use API layer for database operations
3. **Add Testing Framework**: Include Jest, React Testing Library, and E2E testing
4. **Implement Performance Monitoring**: Add analytics and performance tracking
5. **Add Security Hardening**: Include security dependencies for financial UI
6. **Optimize Bundle Size**: Use code splitting and bundle analysis tools
7. **Add Error Tracking**: Include error monitoring for production
8. **Consider PWA Features**: Add offline capabilities for trading
9. **Standardize Real-time Communication**: Choose single WebSocket approach
10. **Add Development Tools**: Include component documentation and design system

## Summary
The frontend package.json represents a solid foundation for a trading bot interface with good use of modern frameworks and shared monorepo packages. However, it suffers from heavy blockchain dependencies that should be moved to backend services, missing testing infrastructure, and lack of production monitoring tools. While it demonstrates good alignment with monorepo practices and modern UI development, it would benefit from optimization for performance, security, and maintainability in a financial trading context.

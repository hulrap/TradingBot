No configuration for Zod or other validation framework types despite advanced configuration validation.

### 19. **Monitoring Library Type Support Absence**
No configuration for monitoring and health check library types despite comprehensive operational features.

### 20. **Advanced Feature Type Configuration Gap**
Configuration doesn't account for advanced TypeScript features that might be needed for sophisticated copy trading logic.

### 21. **Cross-Chain Type Support Missing**
No configuration for multi-chain type definitions despite copy-trader supporting multiple blockchain networks.

### 22. **Financial Calculation Type Safety Gap**
No configuration for financial calculation precision types despite using decimal.js for financial accuracy.

### 23. **Real-Time Processing Type Configuration Missing**
No configuration for real-time processing types and WebSocket libraries despite extensive real-time functionality.

### 24. **Security Library Type Integration Absence**
No configuration for security-related types despite copy trading involving financial operations requiring security.

### 25. **Incremental Build Configuration Missing**
No incremental build configuration despite copy-trader's complex codebase that would benefit from incremental compilation.

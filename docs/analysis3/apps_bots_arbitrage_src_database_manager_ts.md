Implements a standalone database manager instead of leveraging shared database utilities from the monorepo, potentially duplicating functionality available in `@trading-bot/database` or similar packages.

### 2. **Technology Stack Inconsistency**
Uses SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) while the frontend uses different database approaches, creating data integration challenges and potential inconsistencies in the technology stack.

### 3. **Configuration Management Complexity**
Implements custom configuration validation rather than leveraging shared configuration patterns used elsewhere in the codebase, adding unnecessary complexity.

### 4. **Encryption Implementation Gaps**
Implements custom encryption logic without integration with established security practices or shared cryptographic utilities that might exist in the monorepo.

### 5. **Performance Monitoring Duplication**
Creates custom performance monitoring that doesn't integrate with broader system monitoring, potentially duplicating functionality or creating inconsistent metrics.

### 6. **Type Safety Inconsistencies**
Uses manual type assertions for Buffer compatibility instead of proper TypeScript configuration, indicating potential TypeScript setup issues across the monorepo.

### 7. **Error Handling Pattern Deviation**
Uses custom error handling patterns that don't align with established error handling conventions used in other parts of the codebase.

### 8. **Logging Strategy Misalignment**
Expects external winston logger instead of using shared logging utilities, creating potential inconsistencies in log format and handling.

### 9. **Database Schema Management Gap**
Implements custom migration system rather than leveraging established database migration tools or patterns used elsewhere in the project.

### 10. **Backup Strategy Isolation**
Creates independent backup system without integration with broader system backup and disaster recovery strategies.

### 11. **Validation Logic Redundancy**
Implements data validation that might be redundant with validation logic in shared type definitions or business logic layers.

### 12. **Resource Management Concerns**
Creates multiple intervals and timers without clear resource cleanup strategy, potentially leading to resource leaks.

### 13. **Cache Implementation Duplication**
Implements custom caching logic that doesn't integrate with broader caching strategies used across the application.

### 14. **Transaction Management Complexity**
Uses SQLite transactions without integration with broader transaction management patterns or distributed transaction concerns.

### 15. **Security Pattern Deviations**
Implements security features (encryption, access control) without leveraging shared security utilities or following established security patterns.

### 16. **Data Analytics Scope Creep**
Implements extensive analytics functionality that might be better served by dedicated analytics services or shared analytics utilities.

### 17. **Configuration Drift Risk**
Uses environment variable parsing without integration with shared configuration management, creating risk of configuration inconsistencies.

### 18. **Testing Integration Gaps**
No clear integration with testing frameworks or test data management strategies used elsewhere in the monorepo.

### 19. **API Design Inconsistency**
Uses async/await patterns inconsistently and doesn't follow API design patterns established in other parts of the codebase.

### 20. **Dependency Management Issues**
Directly imports Node.js modules without leveraging shared utilities or abstractions that might exist for cross-platform compatibility.

### 21. **Monitoring Integration Absence**
Performance monitoring doesn't integrate with broader application monitoring or alerting systems.

### 22. **Data Governance Gaps**
Implements data retention and archival without integration with broader data governance policies or compliance requirements.

### 23. **Concurrency Management Risks**
Custom mutex implementation doesn't integrate with broader concurrency management patterns or distributed system concerns.

### 24. **Audit Trail Inconsistencies**
Creates audit trails that don't integrate with broader audit and compliance systems used elsewhere in the application.

### 25. **Deployment Strategy Misalignment**
SQLite-based approach doesn't align with scalable deployment strategies that might be needed for a trading bot system.

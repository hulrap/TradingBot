## Critical Issues

### **HARDCODED DEFAULT BOT CONFIGURATIONS**
**Issue**: Hardcoded default bot configurations instead of using shared configuration or constants.

**Evidence**: 
```typescript
const defaultBots: BotStatus[] = [
  {
    id: 'arbitrage',
    type: 'arbitrage',
    name: 'Arbitrage Bot',
    description: 'Exploits price differences across DEXs for profit opportunities.',
    // ... hardcoded configuration
  },
  // ... more hardcoded bots
];
```

**Impact**: 
- Duplicated bot configuration data across components
- Difficult to maintain consistent bot information
- Missing integration with shared bot configuration system
- Risk of configuration drift between components

### **MISSING INTEGRATION WITH SHARED TYPES**
**Issue**: Custom BotStatus interface instead of using shared bot type system.

**Evidence**: 
- Custom BotStatus interface defined locally
- Missing integration with comprehensive shared type system
- Duplicated type definitions that exist in shared packages
- Independent type definitions instead of centralized types

**Impact**: 
- Type fragmentation across the application
- Missing benefits of comprehensive shared type system
- Duplicated type maintenance effort
- Inconsistent typing across components

### **LIMITED REAL-TIME UPDATES**
**Issue**: Static bot status display without real-time updates or WebSocket integration.

**Evidence**: 
- Bot status fetched only on component mount
- No real-time updates for bot status changes
- Missing integration with real-time bot monitoring
- Static profit/loss display without live updates

**Impact**: 
- Users see outdated bot status information
- Poor user experience for active trading monitoring
- Missing critical real-time trading information
- Reduced effectiveness for active bot management

### **NO PERFORMANCE METRICS INTEGRATION**
**Issue**: Basic bot status display without integration with comprehensive performance analytics.

**Evidence**: 
- Simple profit/loss display without detailed metrics
- Missing integration with performance analytics API
- No risk metrics or detailed performance indicators
- Limited bot performance visibility

**Impact**: 
- Users lack comprehensive bot performance insights
- Missing critical trading performance information
- Poor integration with sophisticated analytics infrastructure
- Reduced value for serious trading operations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Shared Configuration Integration**: Use shared bot configuration system instead of hardcoded defaults
2. **Shared Types Integration**: Integrate with comprehensive shared type system
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket integration for real-time bot status updates
4. **Performance Integration**: Integrate with performance analytics API for comprehensive metrics

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Advanced Dashboard**: Implement comprehensive dashboard with real-time monitoring
2. **Bot Management Enhancement**: Add advanced bot management features with detailed controls
3. **Performance Analytics**: Integrate sophisticated performance analytics and reporting
4. **Notification System**: Add real-time notifications for bot status changes and alerts

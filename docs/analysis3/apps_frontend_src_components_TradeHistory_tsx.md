## Critical Issues

### **MISSING INTEGRATION WITH SHARED TYPES**
**Issue**: Custom trade interface instead of using shared type system.

**Evidence**: 
```typescript
interface Trade {
    id: string;
    timestamp: string;
    profit: string;
    // ... custom interface instead of shared types
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Type system fragmentation across components
- Potential inconsistencies with API and backend types
- Maintenance burden of multiple type definitions
- Missing benefits of comprehensive shared type system

### **LIMITED REAL-TIME CAPABILITIES**
**Issue**: Basic polling approach instead of sophisticated real-time updates.

**Evidence**: 
- Simple 30-second interval polling
- No WebSocket or real-time data stream integration
- Missing integration with real-time trading infrastructure
- Basic refresh approach without optimization

**Impact**: 
- Delayed trade data updates for users
- Higher server load from frequent polling
- Missing real-time trading experience
- Poor integration with live trading operations

### **BASIC DATA DISPLAY WITHOUT ADVANCED FEATURES**
**Issue**: Simple table display without advanced trading data features.

**Evidence**: 
- Basic table without sorting, filtering, or pagination
- No advanced trade analytics or insights
- Missing integration with performance metrics
- Limited data visualization capabilities

**Impact**: 
- Poor user experience for large trade datasets
- Missing trading insights and analytics
- Limited functionality for serious traders
- No integration with broader trading analytics

### **NO INTEGRATION WITH SHARED UI COMPONENTS**
**Issue**: Custom table implementation instead of using shared UI component library.

**Evidence**: 
- Custom table markup instead of shared table components
- Independent styling instead of shared design system
- Missing integration with shared UI patterns
- Custom loading and error states instead of shared components

**Impact**: 
- Inconsistent UI patterns across the application
- Maintenance burden of custom implementations
- Missing shared design system benefits
- Duplicated UI development effort

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Integrate Shared Types**: Use shared type system for trade data consistency
2. **Adopt Shared UI Components**: Replace custom table with shared UI components
3. **Real-time Integration**: Implement WebSocket or real-time data streams
4. **Advanced Features**: Add sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Analytics Integration**: Integrate with shared analytics and performance tracking
2. **Advanced Visualization**: Add charts and advanced data visualization
3. **Export Capabilities**: Add data export and reporting features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

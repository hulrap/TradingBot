# File Analysis: apps/bots/copy-trader/src/mempool-monitor.ts

## Overview
This file implements a sophisticated mempool monitoring system with comprehensive transaction decoding, MEV detection, rate limiting, health monitoring, and database integration. It represents one of the most complex and feature-rich monitoring components in the trading bot system.

## 20+ Criteria Analysis

### 1. **Shared Package Integration Absence**
Implements extensive mempool monitoring functionality independently instead of leveraging the sophisticated `MempoolMonitor` and related utilities available in the `@trading-bot/chain-client` package.

### 2. **Database Technology Isolation**
Uses `better-sqlite3` directly for local data storage instead of integrating with shared database patterns or distributed database systems used elsewhere in the codebase.

### 3. **Event System Simplicity**
Uses basic EventEmitter pattern instead of integrating with broader event-driven architecture, message queues, or event streaming systems.

### 4. **Configuration Management Duplication**
Implements extensive configuration management locally instead of leveraging shared configuration validation and management frameworks.

### 5. **Logging Strategy Independence**
Uses custom winston configuration instead of integrating with shared logging infrastructure and patterns established in the codebase.

### 6. **Rate Limiting Implementation Redundancy**
Implements custom TokenBucketRateLimiter instead of leveraging rate limiting utilities available in shared packages or the chain client.

### 7. **Transaction Decoding Logic Duplication**
Extensive transaction decoding logic that likely duplicates functionality available in the sophisticated chain client package.

### 8. **MEV Detection Implementation Isolation**
Custom MEV detection patterns instead of leveraging MEV detection and protection systems available in shared utilities.

Custom provider and WebSocket management instead of leveraging connection pooling and provider management from the chain client.

### 10. **Health Monitoring Duplication**
Implements custom health monitoring that doesn't integrate with broader system monitoring and observability infrastructure.

### 11. **Interface Management Complexity**
Manages extensive ABI interfaces locally instead of leveraging contract interface management utilities from shared packages.

### 12. **Error Handling Pattern Inconsistency**
Custom error handling and retry mechanisms that don't align with error handling patterns used elsewhere in the codebase.

### 13. **State Management Complexity**
Complex in-memory state management without integration with distributed state management or caching systems.

### 14. **Performance Monitoring Independence**
Custom performance tracking that doesn't integrate with shared performance monitoring and analytics systems.

Custom batch processing logic instead of leveraging batch processing utilities or patterns from shared infrastructure.

### 16. **Chain Abstraction Missing**
Direct chain interaction without leveraging chain abstraction layers available in the enhanced chain client.

### 17. **Resource Management Concerns**
Multiple timers, intervals, and connections without coordination with broader system resource management.

### 18. **Security Pattern Implementation**
Security considerations implemented locally without integration with shared security infrastructure or validation systems.

### 19. **Testing Infrastructure Absence**
Complex monitoring logic without clear integration with testing frameworks or mock services for validation.

### 20. **Service Architecture Monolithic Approach**
Implements comprehensive functionality in a single class instead of decomposing into specialized services or leveraging shared service patterns.

### 21. **Protocol Support Hardcoding**
Hardcoded protocol support (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.) instead of leveraging dynamic protocol discovery and integration.

### 22. **Database Schema Management Isolation**
Custom database schema management instead of leveraging shared database migration and schema management utilities.

### 23. **Monitoring Integration Gaps**
Health monitoring that doesn't integrate with broader system monitoring, alerting, or observability platforms.

### 24. **Configuration Validation Redundancy**
Custom configuration validation instead of leveraging shared validation frameworks like those used in other parts of the system.

### 25. **API Integration Primitiveness**
Basic RPC/WebSocket integration without leveraging sophisticated API management, retry policies, or failover mechanisms.

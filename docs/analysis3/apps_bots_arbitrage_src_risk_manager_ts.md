Limited risk reporting capabilities without integration with comprehensive reporting and dashboard systems.

### 22. **Backtesting Integration Absence**
No integration with backtesting frameworks for risk model validation and optimization.

### 23. **Market Regime Detection Missing**
No market regime detection or dynamic risk adjustment based on market conditions.

### 24. **Stress Testing Absence**
No stress testing capabilities or integration with stress testing frameworks.

### 25. **Risk Appetite Framework Missing**
No integration with broader risk appetite framework or enterprise risk management systems.

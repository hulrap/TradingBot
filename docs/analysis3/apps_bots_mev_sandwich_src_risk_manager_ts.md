# Analysis: apps/bots/mev-sandwich/src/risk-manager.ts

## Overview
This file implements a comprehensive risk management system for MEV sandwich attacks, containing 596 lines of complex risk assessment, position tracking, and circuit breaker logic. It duplicates significant functionality available in the shared @trading-bot/risk-management package.

## Architectural Misalignment Analysis

- **Impact**: Circuit breaker implementation without shared reliability patterns
- **Misalignment**: Should use shared circuit breaker infrastructure

### 6. **Financial Calculation Integration**
- **Issue**: Financial calculations mixed with risk assessment
- **Impact**: Risk logic coupled with financial calculations
- **Misalignment**: Should separate risk assessment from financial calculations

### 7. **Event-Driven Architecture Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: Uses EventEmitter but with risk-specific patterns
- **Impact**: Risk events without standardized event patterns
- **Misalignment**: Should use consistent event patterns across components

### 8. **Metrics Tracking Duplication**
- **Issue**: Custom risk metrics instead of using shared metrics
- **Impact**: Risk metrics without shared observability infrastructure
- **Misalignment**: Should integrate with shared metrics system

### 9. **Time-Based Limit Management**
- **Issue**: Custom time-based tracking and limits
- **Impact**: Time management without shared temporal utilities
- **Misalignment**: Should use shared time-based limit services

### 10. **Position Size Calculation Logic**
- **Issue**: Chain-specific position size calculations
- **Impact**: Position sizing without shared position management
- **Misalignment**: Should use shared position sizing algorithms

### 11. **Portfolio Risk Assessment**
- **Issue**: Basic portfolio risk calculations
- **Impact**: Portfolio risk without sophisticated portfolio analytics
- **Misalignment**: Should use advanced portfolio risk models

### 12. **Liquidity Risk Validation**
- **Issue**: Simple liquidity checks without comprehensive analysis
- **Impact**: Liquidity risk assessment without market depth analysis
- **Misalignment**: Should use sophisticated liquidity risk models

### 13. **Gas Price Risk Management**
- **Issue**: Basic gas price limits without dynamic risk adjustment
- **Impact**: Gas risk without network congestion analysis
- **Misalignment**: Should use dynamic gas risk assessment

### 14. **Profit Threshold Validation**
- **Issue**: Simple profit threshold checks
- **Impact**: Profit validation without risk-adjusted requirements
- **Misalignment**: Should use risk-adjusted profit thresholds

### 15. **Trade Frequency Monitoring**
- **Issue**: Basic frequency limits without adaptive controls
- **Impact**: Frequency management without market condition adaptation
- **Misalignment**: Should use adaptive frequency controls

### 16. **Risk Score Calculation**
- **Issue**: Custom risk scoring algorithm
- **Impact**: Risk scoring without shared risk analytics
- **Misalignment**: Should use standardized risk scoring infrastructure

### 17. **Emergency Stop Logic**
- **Issue**: Basic emergency stop without sophisticated triggers
- **Impact**: Emergency controls without advanced risk detection
- **Misalignment**: Should use advanced emergency response systems

### 18. **Drawdown Calculation**
- **Issue**: Simple drawdown tracking without statistical analysis
- **Impact**: Drawdown monitoring without sophisticated risk metrics
- **Misalignment**: Should use advanced drawdown analysis

### 19. **Consecutive Failure Tracking**
- **Issue**: Basic failure counting without pattern analysis
- **Impact**: Failure tracking without failure pattern detection
- **Misalignment**: Should use intelligent failure analysis

### 20. **Risk Recommendation Generation**
- **Issue**: Simple recommendation logic
- **Impact**: Risk advice without sophisticated decision support
- **Misalignment**: Should use advanced recommendation engines

### 21. **Daily Metrics Management**
- **Issue**: Manual daily metrics calculation and reset
- **Impact**: Metrics management without automated infrastructure
- **Misalignment**: Should use shared metrics infrastructure

### 22. **Position Timeout Handling**
- **Issue**: Basic timeout management without sophisticated position lifecycle
- **Impact**: Position management without advanced lifecycle controls
- **Misalignment**: Should use shared position lifecycle management

### 23. **Configuration Update Logic**
- **Issue**: Simple configuration updates without validation
- **Impact**: Risk configuration changes without proper validation
- **Misalignment**: Should use schema-validated configuration management

### 24. **Win Rate Calculation**
- **Issue**: Basic win rate calculation without statistical significance
- **Impact**: Performance metrics without statistical analysis
- **Misalignment**: Should use statistical performance analysis

### 25. **Testing and Validation Issues**
- **Issue**: Complex risk logic difficult to test comprehensively
- **Impact**: Risk management without proper validation
- **Misalignment**: Should be decomposed for better testability

## Recommendations

1. **Leverage Shared Risk Management**: Use and extend @trading-bot/risk-management package
2. **Decompose Risk Assessment**: Split into modular risk components
3. **Implement Persistent Storage**: Use database for position and metrics tracking
4. **Use Shared Configuration**: Leverage shared configuration management
5. **Integrate Circuit Breakers**: Use shared reliability patterns
6. **Separate Financial Logic**: Extract financial calculations to dedicated services
7. **Standardize Events**: Use consistent event patterns
8. **Add Advanced Analytics**: Implement sophisticated risk models
9. **Use Shared Metrics**: Integrate with observability infrastructure
10. **Improve Testability**: Make risk components easily testable

## Summary
The risk manager represents comprehensive risk management capabilities but suffers from significant duplication of functionality available in the shared @trading-bot/risk-management package. While functionally sophisticated with features like circuit breakers, position tracking, and comprehensive risk assessment, it creates maintenance overhead and inconsistency by reimplementing shared risk management patterns. It would benefit significantly from leveraging and extending the shared risk management infrastructure.

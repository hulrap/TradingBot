- No performance benchmarking tasks

**Impact**: 
- Missed opportunities for automated trading-specific validation
- No automated security checks for financial applications
- Missing performance validation for trading algorithms

### **LIMITED TEST CONFIGURATION**
**Issue**: Basic test configuration without trading-specific testing requirements.

**Evidence**: 
- Generic test task without specialized trading test categories
- No paper trading test integration
- Missing stress testing configuration
- No compliance testing tasks

**Impact**: 
- Insufficient testing validation for financial applications
- Missing critical trading-specific test scenarios

## Recommendations

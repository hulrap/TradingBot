## Critical Issues

### **MISSING SHARED UI COMPONENT INTEGRATION**
**Issue**: No integration with the sophisticated shared UI component library despite its availability.

**Evidence**: 
- Direct CSS class usage instead of shared UI utilities
- Missing integration with shared design system
- No use of shared UI components for consistent styling
- Custom styling instead of leveraging shared component library

**Impact**: 
- Inconsistent styling patterns across the application
- Missed opportunities for design system consistency
- Duplicated styling logic instead of shared utilities
- Poor maintainability of custom styling approaches

### **LIMITED ERROR HANDLING AND MONITORING**
**Issue**: Basic layout without error boundaries or comprehensive error handling for trading application.

**Evidence**: 
- No error boundary implementation for robust error handling
- Missing monitoring integration for production trading interface
- No error tracking or logging setup at root level
- Limited fault tolerance for critical trading application

**Impact**: 
- Poor user experience when errors occur in trading interface
- Missing error tracking and monitoring in production
- Potential application crashes without proper error boundaries
- Limited debugging capabilities for production issues

### **MISSING TRADING-SPECIFIC FEATURES**
**Issue**: Generic layout without trading-specific features or optimizations.

**Evidence**: 
- No trading-specific context providers or state management
- Missing real-time data connection setup
- No trading-specific security headers or configurations
- Limited trading application-specific optimizations

**Impact**: 
- Missed opportunities for trading-specific optimizations
- Incomplete foundation for complex trading interface requirements
- Missing centralized trading-specific infrastructure setup

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Integrate Shared UI**: Use shared UI component library for consistent styling and components
2. **Add Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries for robust error handling
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add monitoring and logging integration for production trading interface
4. **Trading Context**: Add trading-specific context providers and state management

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Advanced Security**: Add comprehensive security headers and trading-specific security measures
2. **Real-Time Infrastructure**: Integrate real-time data connection and WebSocket management
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring and optimization for trading operations
4. **Advanced Features**: Enhance with trading-specific features and optimizations

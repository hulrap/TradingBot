# Analysis: apps/bots/mev-sandwich/src/execution-engine.ts

**File Type**: Core Bot Implementation - MEV Execution Engine
**Lines of Code**: 790
**Completion Status**: 85% - Comprehensive Execution System with Integration Gaps
**External Research**: N/A - Complex MEV execution with good architecture

## Summary
This is a sophisticated MEV sandwich execution engine that orchestrates the complete execution pipeline from opportunity validation to bundle submission across multiple chains (Ethereum, BSC, Solana). The implementation includes comprehensive simulation, monitoring, and statistics tracking. It integrates with specialized MEV clients for each chain and provides robust error handling and execution management. This represents one of the most complete MEV execution systems in the codebase.

## Category Analysis

### 1. Placeholder/Mock Code
- **Found**: Some simplified implementations
  - Line 273: Hardcoded token decimals (18) instead of fetching actual values
  - Line 275: Hardcoded token prices (1.0) for profit calculations
  - Line 277: Hardcoded pool fee (300 basis points)
  - Line 416: Simplified block number using Date.now()
- **Priority**: Medium - Core logic is sophisticated but needs real data integration
- **Implementation Need**: Replace hardcoded values with real token/pool data

### 2. Missing Implementations
- **Missing**: 
  - Real token metadata fetching (decimals, prices)
  - Dynamic pool fee fetching from DEX contracts
  - Advanced bundle priority optimization
  - Cross-chain execution coordination
  - Failed execution recovery mechanisms
  - Advanced monitoring and alerting
  - Execution performance analytics
  - Bundle competition analysis
- **Dependencies**: Token APIs, DEX contracts, monitoring infrastructure
- **Effort**: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation

### 3. Logic Errors
- **Issues Found**:
  - Hardcoded token decimals could cause calculation errors
  - Simplified block number generation for BSC
  - No validation of bundle inclusion probability
  - Limited error recovery for failed executions
- **Impact**: Potential execution failures and suboptimal bundle submission
- **Fix Complexity**: Medium - requires real data integration and error handling

### 4. Integration Gaps
- **Disconnects**: 
  - No integration with real token metadata APIs

### 5. Configuration Centralization
- **Hardcoded Values**: 
  - DEX router addresses hardcoded in submission methods
  - Default values scattered throughout execution logic
  - Gas estimation parameters embedded in code
- **Scattered Config**: Most configuration properly structured in interfaces
- **Missing Centralization**: External API endpoints and chain-specific parameters
- **Validation Needs**: Good interface-based configuration with execution parameters

### 6. Dependencies & Packages
- **Current Packages**: 
  - ethers.js - appropriate for Ethereum interactions
  - @solana/web3.js - appropriate for Solana interactions
  - EventEmitter - for event-driven architecture

### 11. Documentation Gaps
- **Missing Docs**: 
  - No comprehensive execution flow documentation
  - Missing MEV strategy documentation
  - No chain-specific execution guide
- **Unclear Code**: Complex execution logic could benefit from more detailed comments
- **API Docs**: Well-defined interfaces but missing execution methodology docs

### 12. Testing Gaps
- **Unit Tests**: No tests for execution pipeline
- **Integration Tests**: No tests for multi-chain execution

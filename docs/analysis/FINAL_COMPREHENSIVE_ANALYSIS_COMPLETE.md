## Updated Security Analysis

### **Critical Security Vulnerabilities** ❌

**1. Crypto Package - Fixed Salt Vulnerability**
```typescript
// CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW
const FIXED_SALT = 'trading-bot-salt-2024';
export function encrypt(data: string): string {
  return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, FIXED_SALT).toString();
}
```
**Impact**: All encrypted private keys can be decrypted
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Complete financial loss possible

**2. Authentication System Multiple Vulnerabilities**
```typescript
// DANGEROUS: Using user.id as authentication token
login(user.id); // This is not a secure token!

// No API authentication on critical endpoints
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json(await getBotStatus()); // No auth check
}
```
**Impact**: Complete authentication bypass and unauthorized bot control
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Unauthorized access to all funds

**3. Private Key Exposure in Frontend**
```typescript
// Private keys exposed in web forms
<input type="password" placeholder="Enter private key" />
```
**Impact**: Private keys transmitted and stored insecurely
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Complete wallet compromise
